# Description
A playlist-based Discord music bot.

_But others probably can't use it because I hid my robot's token._

If you replace the token with yours, then this program should be able to run.

# Features

It provides a playlist that will add all the searched songs to the list.

You can use the audio from YouTube videos, including live streams, as an audio source for playback.

You can change the play mode, such as single-track playback, playlist playback, single-track loop, and shuffle playback.

_Attention: The current version may not be able to change the play mode when playing music. So it's best to change the play mode after the playback_

# Version

_discord_bot_ is the Chinese version

_discord_bot_en_ is the English version
